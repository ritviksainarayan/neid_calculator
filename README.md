# NEID Exposure Time Calculator

This is an Exposure Time Calculator to understand magnitude limits using temperature and SNR as constraints. 

# Python implementation

 Download all files and use the Jupyter notebook `exposures.ipynb` to interact with the plot. Once you implement the interact cell, double clicking the number will allow you to manually add a number. I recommend that you do so to ensure that computational speed is maintained and unnecessary inputs are not being implemented by the function.
