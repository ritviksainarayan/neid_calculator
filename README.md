# NEID Exposure Time Calculator

This is an Exposure Time Calculator to understand magnitude limits using temperature and SNR as constraints. 

# Python implementation

 Download all files and use the Jupyter notebook `exposures.ipynb` to interact with the plot. Once you implement the interact cell, double clicking the number will allow you to manually add a number. I recommend that you do so to ensure that computational speed is maintained and unnecessary inputs are not being implemented by the function. 

# Models 

All calculations are based on BT-Settl synthetic stellar spectra (with logg = 4.5 and solar metallicity), available at: http://phoenix.astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de/?page_id=15. 

# Credit

A large portion of the code and the models come from `NEID-ETC` by Jason Wright, available at: https://neid-etc.tuc.noirlab.edu/calc_shell/calculate_exp_snr.
